<p>Post Mortem:</p>
<p>I was generally pretty happy with how my project turned out. I think it is extendable and can be used in multiple
    situations. That being said, there are a few things I would change or update if I had more time. Number one
    would be how my physics engine works and is called. I overall think my physics engine works very well and
    provides a real way of how physics feel. But, going forward, having say the physics update being called more
    often then the regular update or having something like fixed update would be better. I saw that I had to account
    for overlap in my physics engine because it would not always catch the collisions correctly. This has a lot to due
    with frame capping and how that might change over a project.</p>
<p>
    The second thing would be to extend my GUI system even more. As I said the engine is pretty extendable,
    but having a GUI without premade assets, or even being able to add scripts would take it in that direction.
    Scripts are supposed to handle game logic and so giving a user a way to do that in a simpler sense
    really increases usability.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to change my input component. The way it is done right now is that you would have to
    add a member function for every key pressed, as well as a variable to track. Overall not the best way to do
    this as we would have to rebuild the c++ engine a lot. I think finding maybe a key system where returning a
    specific int gets a result and have that correlate to a specific button. Or having it return a string with
    the name of the key pressed. These are all ideas, but it was something I think I would want to change with
    more time.</p>
